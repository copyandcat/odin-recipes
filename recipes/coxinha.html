    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So what is a coxinha? The coxinha (pronounced co-shee-nya) is a popular food in Brazil, consisting of a dough shaped in the form of a chicken leg and usually filled with shredded chicken and deep fried. It is usually served in parties, bars, street fairs and/or in coffee shops and bakeries and it comes in lots of different sizes, from cocktail sizes to large ones that can substitute a meal. They are great if accompanied by some beer! :-)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 (8 oz) package of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large potato</li>
        <li>2.5 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cube of chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>2.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs for breading</li>
        <li>Bowl of ice cold water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the chicken and the potato in 8 cups of water and 1 cube of chicken bouillon, over medium heat. Once the potato and the chicken are fork tender, take them out and reserve 2.5 cups of the broth for the dough.</li>
        <li>Mash the potato and reserve. Shred the chicken and reserve.</li>
        <li>Bring the broth back to the pot and add the mashed potatoes and the butter. Cook under medium heat. When it boils, add the flour a little at a time, stirring constantly, until it forms a dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a clean counter. Knead the dough while it's still warm, until silky and smooth.</li>
        <li>To make the filling, saut√© the onions and garlic until translucent and the add the chicken, poultry seasoning and the parsley. Mix everything together and season with salt and pepper. Add the cream cheese and cook until the cream cheese is melted and everything is incorporated.</li>
        <li>To assemble the coxinhas, take a little piece of the dough and form a ping pong sized ball. Flatten it into a disc, hollowing up the middle for the filling.</li>
        <li>Spoon a tablespoon of the filling into the middle of dough and press the dough closed around the filling, shaping it like a teardrop. Continue until you run out of dough.</li>
        <li>To coat your coxinhas with breadcrumbs, first wet one of your hands with cold water and pass it on the coxinha. Then, coat the coxinha with breadcrumbs. Set it aside in a baking sheet and continue to coat all your coxinhas.</li>
        <li>Fill a Dutch oven or large pot with enough vegetable oil to cover the coxinhas.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil and fry your coxinhas in batches, until they're golden brown.</li>
        <li>Place the fried coxinhas on a plate covered with paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
